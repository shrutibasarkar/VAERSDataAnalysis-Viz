# VAERS- Event based Reporting

Analyzed and visualized the CDC Wonder dataset downloaded from the website (http://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html)
I used this dataset to convey how the risk exposure percentage varies according to the age group, sex and vaccine type to various audience.

I have used Prezi for creating presentations for the three audiences (Public, Hospital Management and Healthcare workers). Please find the links below:
